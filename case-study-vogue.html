  <!--    <h2>My role</h2>
      <p class="mb-5">I was the only UX designer on this project. My task was to create the specifications for the minimum viable product based on the client’s requirements and technical restrictions and to supervise the website design and development.</p>
-->
      <h2>Research and specification</h2>
      <p class="mb-5">My first task was to do research - conduct desk studies and describe the target user. These were by two main criteria. The minor group is the buyers - those who are keen on having an original piece from a luxurious brand. The major are watchers - those who follow trends, but usually looks for the inspiration and ends up buying a less expensive piece. The first ones were potential product buyers, the second ones were content (advertisement) consumers.</p>

      <h2>Design and wireframes</h2>
      <p class="mb-5">After collecting clients' requirements, I created information architecture and started to work on wireframes in Axure. The goal was to enable the editors to present the content engagingly and diversely. I went on with running workshops with the client in which the whole structure and scope were evaluated. After that, I pursued more detailed wireframes.</p>

      <h2>Team collaboration</h2>
      <p>Wireframes were constantly reviewed and evaluated with developers and clients, in order to be able to deliver the project on time. </p>
      <p>When dealing with an ad-hoc and constantly changing project like this one, we had to communicate constantly. I collaborated closely with the whole team on a daily basis including regular meetings with the graphic designer to make every detail perfect; daily communication with the client to answer all their questions; processing of new requirements; meetings with the development team to make sure they are informed of the latest changes; and checking the functionality of what had been implemented.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Another challenge was that for all of the modular components, we had to think of how will they look like in CMS, so the editors will be able to use it effectively.</p>

      <h2>Launch</h2>
      <p>The launch happened at midnight with the solemn countdown. We successfully (and miraculously) launched everything on time and started to sell premium Vogue subscription immediately.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">The website <b>exceeded all the KPIs</b> - visits, printed magazine subscriptions, newsletter subscriptions, returning visitors and impressions.</p>

  <!--    <h2>Personal takeaways</h2>
      <p>When dealing with an ad-hoc and constantly changing project like this one, the best way to be efficient is to be in constant communication with the developers and designers, so that all features are implemented effectively.</p>
