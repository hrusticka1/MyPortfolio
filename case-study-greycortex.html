      <h2>My role</h2>
      <p>I was hired as a freelance UX/UI designer and my goal was to find usability issues and propose solutions.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">This project was implemented as a practical part of my diploma thesis, for which I received an A grade. The theoretical part described a perception of visual stimuli in the context of interface usability (specifically information dashboards) and the principles by which the usability could be increased.</p>

      <h2>The challenge and goals</h2>
      <p>The first design of MA contained only basic functions. After some time, the system grew, new features were implemented, and all new user interface (UI) elements were add-ons to existing solutions without deeper forward planning of the interface as a whole. As a result, it became visually cluttered and more difficult to use.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Accordingly, the redesign goal was to improve MA's usability, make the interface simpler, and create new graphic design guidelines.  </p>

      <h2>Research and system evaluation</h2>
      <p>First, I went through the whole interface and evaluated each part according to 10 heuristic principles defined by Jacob Nielsen (I’ve had positive experiences with this approach from my previous projects). I divided the whole interface into smaller parts and assigned each part with a number of points for each heuristic principle. Most repeating problems involved effectivity, user control, consistency, and visibility of system status.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">I also conducted competitors analysis and desk research about dashboard usability and best-practices (which was included in the theoretical part of my thesis).</p>

      <h2>Users</h2>
      <p>I gained insights from interviewing users, including the product owner, the MA developer, the MA tester and the sales agent, who was regularly in touch with end users. I conducted semi-structured interviews, during which I asked questions about their onboarding period with MA, their usual tasks, goals, etc.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Based on these interviews, I created 3 proto-personas: IT technician, data analyst, and MA employee.</p>

      <h2>Project Stages</h2>
      <p>After reviewing the scope with the project manager, we decided to divide the project into smaller chunks, which I would gradually work within stages.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">I started the redesign process with filtration, navigation and dashboard controllers. These were critical parts for the user and his/her interaction with the system, as their low usability could cause immediate frustration in many cases. Moreover, we could test and implement these changes quite quickly and their improvement would make a significant difference.</p>

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>I used Axure as a wireframing and prototyping tool. I chose it because it allows me to work with dynamic panel states and effectively create a prototype.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">I simplified the main navigation and reorganized the dashboard controllers, so they are placed contextually. I removed or repaired poorly used UI and allowed the user to customize filter items.</p>

      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <p class="mb-5">The goal was mainly to discover whether or not I was on the right track and to uncover usability issues. I focused on three areas: Navigation and information architecture, Dashboard controllers, Filtration. I prepared a series of tasks, during which I observed users working with my Axure prototype. </p>

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>No major issues were discovered during testing, although I got some useful feedback. Thanks to a new point of view of the users, I was able to adjust my prototype in order to make the design more intuitive. I will test these changes in next user testing.</p>
      <p>Next stage, dashboards.</p>
