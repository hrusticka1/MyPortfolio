      <h3>My role</h3>
      <p>My goal as a designer was to adress and solve usability issues in Mendel Analyst - network traffic analysis solution developed by startup GreyCortex.</p>
      <p class="mb-5 grey-text">This project was implemented as a part of my diploma thesis. The theoretical part described a perception of visual stimuli in the context of interface usability (specifically information dashboards) and the principles by which the usability could be increased.</p>

      <h3>The challenge and goals</h3>
      <p>The first design of MA contained only basic functions. After some time, the system grew, new features were implemented, and all new user interface (UI) elements were add-ons to existing solutions without deeper forward planning of the interface as a whole. As a result, it became visually cluttered and more difficult to use.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Accordingly, the redesign goal was to make the interface simpler, and more variable for the future development.</p>

      <h3>System evaluation</h3>
      <p class="mb-5">First, I went through the whole interface and evaluated each part according to 10 heuristic principles defined by Jacob Nielsen since I’ve had positive experiences with this approach from my previous projects. I divided the whole interface into smaller parts and assigned each part with a number of points for each heuristic principle. Most repeating problems involved effectivity, user control, consistency, and visibility of system status.</p>

      <h3>Users</h3>
      <p>I gained insights from interviewing users, including the product owner, the MA developer, the MA tester and the sales agent, who was regularly in touch with end users. I conducted semi-structured interviews, during which I asked questions about their onboarding period with MA, their usual tasks, goals, etc.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Based on these interviews, I defined 3 proto-personas: IT technician, data analyst, and MA employee.</p>

      <h3>Project Stages</h3>
      <p>After reviewing the scope with the project manager, we decided to divide the project into smaller chunks, which I would gradually work within stages.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">I started the redesign process with filtration, navigation and dashboard controllers. These were critical parts for the user and his/her interaction with the system, as their low usability could cause immediate frustration in many cases. Moreover, we could test and implement these changes quite quickly and their improvement would make a significant difference.</p>

      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <p>I used Axure as a wireframing and prototyping tool.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">I restructured the navigation, so it is clear to the user in which part of the system (s)he is.  I reorganized the dashboard controllers and placed them contextually, instead having them in general settings.</p>
      <p>As for the filters, I decreased the amount of those which are displayed by default only to the most used ones. They are customizable, which allow power users to display and work even with rarely used functions, not relevant for everybody.<p>
      <p class="mb-5">Advanced filtering, was one of the most callenging parts of the system, since it allows user to deep dive into complex settings using 40+ types of settings with logical operators.  I XXXXXXXX</p>

      <h3>User Testing</h3>
      <p class="mb-5">The goal was mainly to discover whether or not I was on the right track with my designs and to test the usability of newly designed changes. I focused on three areas: Navigation and information architecture, Dashboard controllers, Filtration. I prepared a series of tasks, during which I observed users working with my Axure prototype.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Next ASDFGHJKLKJHGFDSA.</p>
