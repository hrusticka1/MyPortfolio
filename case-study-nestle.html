  <!--    <h2>My role</h2>
      <p class="mb-5">I was a UX designer collaborating with the creative team, in order to create a unified campaign ecosystem in line with the client’s brand book.</p>
-->
      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p class="">Our brief was to create an ecosystem for summer consumer campaign. The creative idea, competition mechanics, the web and social media.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">The client fell in love with the idea of linking the online and offline worlds by allowing users to send postcards to their loved ones. However, we encountered a number of obstacles in making the campaign cost-effective. Working with the creative team, we came up with rules for the game that accounted for all of our problems. Unfortunately, the rules were more complex than we had hoped. It was my task to make them look simple. Easy, right?</p>

      <h2>Touchpoints</h2>
      <p class="mb-5">The promotion started before the competition began and continued in waves until its end. It included a series of Facebook posts, Youtube bumper ads, and paid banners on selected websites, in addition to rollups in stores. We were expecting many users to arrive at our website from mobile devices due to the promos in shops.</p>

      <h2>Wireframe and prototype</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">First I created a flowchart showing all possible states that the user would navigate through on the website. Then I created wireframes in Sketch showing all permutations.</p>
      <ul class="mb-2">
        <li>The first version was a teaser before the competition began providing information about the upcoming competition.</li>
        <li>The second version was the most important one during the campaign itself, including the ability to log in and create a user profile, as well as send a postcard.</li>
        <li>The third version was after the competition was closed, displaying the number of postcards sent and inviting participants to log in or check their emails for results.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-5">Finally, using Invision, I created a prototype, which was used as a part of the testing material and later after a set of user testings as a part of documentation for graphic designers and developers.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>We've measured the performance through Google Analytics and database reports. We achieved all our KPIs; conversions on registration, on postcards being sent and on code insertion.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">I was especially pleased with the high level of conversion that we achieved on all of these numbers with a majority of visits coming from mobile phone users.</p>

<!--      <h2>Personal takeaways</h2>
      <p>With in-store rollups (or any offline advertisement) you can count on a vast number of mobile visits. This was a project in which a mobile-first approach really paid off.</p>
